                <h3>Achieving Attainable Equitable Quality Education in a Post Coronavirus Global Environment</h3>
                <p>
                    The Coronavirus pandemic of 2020 left a generation of children disadvantaged, particularly
                    those who did not benefit from the facilities to receive an education at home.</br>
                    Development and research were carried out with the intention of creating an approachable
                    learning environment, which could facilitate the education of literacy, mathematics, and the
                    world to children, regardless of global phenomenon.</br>
                    This page summarises some of the key elements of system design that enabled the functionality of
                    Kikstart.</br>

                <h3>Data Design and Model</h3>
                <img src="img/datamodel.png" alt="Data model diagram for the solution."></img>
                <p>
                    System functionality was facilitated through a SQL database, which allowed for user requirements to
                    be carried out. Both functional and non-functional requirements were defined. Functional
                    requirements
                    clarified what the system had to achieve, whilst non-functional requirements described desired
                    system qualities.</br>
                    Functional requirements included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Remote login and registration</li>
                    <li>Classroom management</li>
                    <li>Task assignment</li>
                    <li>Student score visualisation and updating</li>
                </ul>
                Non-functional requirements that were met included:
                <ul>
                    <li>The ability to change user avatars</li>
                    <li>Password reset functionalities</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>System Architecture Model</h3>
                <p>
                    The system architecture model inaugurates the structure of the solution, and the interaction of
                    elements that took place during system operation. The flow of data and change of data control that
                    took
                    place during system processing is also visualised (data workflow).

                <h3>System Layout and Design</h3>
                <p>
                    The system layout comprised of large, stylised icons that would appeal to children using the system.
                    In aid
                    of accessibility, navigation was conducted through these graphics. These interactive hotspots within
                    the system had
                    consistent positioning throughout to the same effect.

                    <img id="header" src="img/header.png" alt="System header screenshot, annotated."></img>

                    Both teachers and students had an interactive dashboard. For students, the tasks shown on their
                    dashboard
                    would update depending on task completion and task assignment. Teachers were responsible for
                    assigning
                    tasks to their students.

                    <img id="dashboard" src="img/dashboard.png" alt="Student dashboard screenshot."></img>

                    It was important to provide clear visual feedback throughout the system, which included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Generated alerts</li>
                    <li>Answer marking</li>
                    <li>Interactable elements increasing size when highlighted</li>
                </ul>
                <img id="login" src="img/login.png" alt="Login error alert screenshot."></img>
                The managed interface augmented user experiences throughout the system. Consistent interactivity
                and layout enabled for a user friendly and intuitive experience. </br>
                The solution was primarily developed in Visual Studio Code using HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. Files were
                stored on a QUB database as PHP files to accommodate server-side functionalities. CSS was used to
                influence the presentation of the web pages, with Bootstrap being used as a framework for the CSS that was modified
                to suit the implementation of the software.
